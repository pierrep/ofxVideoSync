# ofxVideoSync

Addon for synching video playback of multiple videos, both on multiple OF apps on a single machine using localhost and across a local network.

Currently tested and works on Raspberry Pi 3 and desktop Linux.

You need to connect devices using a LAN cable, WIFI isn't reliable enough to sync.

This addon took inspiration from the following project: https://github.com/turingmachine/omxplayer-sync

On Rasberry Pi you'll need to use my ofxOMXPlayer branch that fixes seeking - https://github.com/pierrep/ofxOMXPlayer/tree/SeekingFix
